</p>

<p><b>General Conditions</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your QuipSphere account by logging into the Service and completing the form available here: https://QuipSphere.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</li>

You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service.

<li>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</li>
<li>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that QuipSphere is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user.

<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. QuipSphere does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that QuipSphere is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if QuipSphere has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the QuipSphere Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</li>
<li>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</li>
<li>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with QuipSphere's express consent).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Rights</b></p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>QuipSphere does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to QuipSphere a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://QuipSphere.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that QuipSphere may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.</li>
        <li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by QuipSphere ("QuipSphere Content"). QuipSphere Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and QuipSphere, QuipSphere owns and retains all rights in the QuipSphere Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the QuipSphere Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the QuipSphere Content.The QuipSphere name and logo are trademarks of QuipSphere, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of QuipSphere, except in accordance with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.QuipSphere-brand.com/. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of QuipSphere, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from QuipSphere.</li>
        <li>Although it is QuipSphere's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, QuipSphere reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by QuipSphere, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, QuipSphere encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, QuipSphere is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. QuipSphere will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</li>
